# RapidSMS configuration file.


# -- RAPIDSMS
#
# The main configuration of the RapidSMS server. It contains a list of
# apps and backends to run, which can be names of app classes, or (in the
# case of multiple apps or backends of the same type) names for apps of
# the same type (see APPS and BACKENDS sections below).
#
# apps=[app1,app2,app3,...]         * comma-separated list of apps to load
# backends=[backend1,backend2,...]  * comma-separated list of backends to load

# Database configuration info.

#
# engine={sqlite3,mysql,postgresql,oracle,postgresql_psycopg2}  * defaults to sqlite3

#   Running on PostgreSQL to see the effect on speed.

# Configure the built-in log module of RapidSMS.
#
# level={debug,info,warning,error,critical}     * defaults to debug
# file=<full-path-to-log-file>                  * defaults to /tmp/rapidsms.log

# -- APPS
#
# In this area you can define configurations for individual applications. The app
# must be listed under the section [rapidsms] in "apps". If no configuration is
# listed for your app it will use the default parameters. However, if you wish to
# run two apps of the same type, you MUST define configure them explicitly here.

# Example settings for gsm backend for use with PyGSM

[webapp]
# define permissions for anonymous (not logged-in) users.
# tabs can be displayed on the dashboard so that visitors will 
# know that more functionality exists and that they need login creds to access them
# BUT we are able to keep things like 'reporters & groups', 'messaging', 'training',
# etc hidden from view
#
# otherwise django auth/permissions would only allow us to have all-or-none
# control of what anonymous users can see.
anon_perms = ['httptester.can_view']


# -- BACKENDS
#
# In this area you can define configurations for individual backends. The backend
# must be listed under the section [rapidsms] in "backends". If no configuration is
# listed for your backend it will use the default parameters. However, if you wish to
# run two backends of the same type, you MUST define configure them explicitly here.

# -- DJANGO
#
# In this area you can define configuration options for django that would usually
# go into your settings.py file. There's no need to make the variables uppercase
# also do not specify strings by surrounding them with the quotes " or '. This
# is automatically taken care of before injecting it into django's core configuration

# An example of how you can specify a cache backend. Caching becomes necessary 
# when you have views or sections that are expensive to generate. Please read 
# http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/
# for more information on how to use the caching capabilities of django.

# Settings for RapidSMS Internationalization
#
# At minimum, you should define 'default_language' and 'languages'. 
# 'languages' specifies the supported languages. It is a comma-
# separated list of tuples where the first list in the tuple
# is the language code and the remainder are associated names/aliases.
# You can optionally specify web_languages and sms_languages
# if you want to support different languages in the web vs sms UI.
# web_languages and sms_languages override languages.
#
#default_language=fr
#languages=(fr,Français),(en,English)
#web_languages=(fr,Français),(en,English,Engrish)
#sms_languages=(fr,Français),(de,German),(en,English)
